In this folder you can find the groundtruth odometry files for all datasets and robots with the following format

<code> timestamp x y z qx qy qz qw </code>

where `timestamp` is the timestamp in seconds, `x y z` are the position in meters and `qx qy qz qw` are the quaternion components of the orientation.
